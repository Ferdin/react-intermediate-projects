RULES OF HOOKS

We should not conditionally set the hooks in react. This can mess up the linked list of hooks that was placed in order.

Avoid early return. This can skip the hooks succeeding to the return JSX block.

Creating a state
Simple
eg:- const [count, setCount] = useState(23)

Based on Function

eg:- const [count, setCount] = useState(
    () => localStorage.getItem('count')
)

Updating state
Simple
eg:- setCount(1000)

Based on current state
eg:- setCount((c) => c + 1)

Make sure that you should not mutate arrays or objects, but replace them with new one.

REUSING LOGIC WITH CUSTOM HOOKS

If you need to reuse UI then go for Component.

If you need to reuse Logic then there are two question that you would need to answer. Does the logic contain any hooks? If it is no then use a regular function. If the answer is yes, it you would need to use a custom hook.
